CALCULATION LOGIC OF "Age" AND "NextBirthday" FOR IMPROVED SPEED AND LESS LOG CLOG

The scheduled method (decorated with @api.model) is designed to update the stored values of Age and NextBirthday once per day rather than on every form view load. 
However, note the following:

Stored Computed Fields:
Because Age and NextBirthday are stored and their compute decorators only list 'BirthDate' as a dependency, they aren’t automatically recomputed when the calendar day changes. 
This prevents unnecessary recalculations on every view load.

Scheduled Update:
The update_age_and_next_birthday method is meant to be run as a daily cron job. When it runs, it recalculates these fields for all contacts with a BirthDate. 
This means that if the calculated values haven’t actually changed (for example, if it isn’t yet a birthday), then even though the method computes them every day, 
the stored values remain the same (and in many cases, Odoo’s write will only trigger an update if the new value is different).

What It Doesn’t Do Out-of-the-Box:
The provided scheduled method doesn’t include a check to update a record only if the value changes; it calculates and writes the new value for every record with a BirthDate. 
You could add such a check to further minimize writes if needed, but in its current form, it avoids the daily recomputation triggered by using fields.Date.today() directly 
in the @api.depends decorator.

In summary, by relying on a scheduled job to update these stored computed fields rather than making them depend on the current date, 
you prevent Odoo from recalculating them every time the contact form is loaded. They only update when the cron job runs (or when BirthDate changes), 
so you’re reducing the overall number of recomputations and related logs.
